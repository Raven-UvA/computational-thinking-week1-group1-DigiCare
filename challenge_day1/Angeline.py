def Act_1():
    return "In the dark and uncomfortable room lies a half-opened letter. It was during midnight where he could clearly hear the crawling of ravens. Phoenix, he was wearing rectangular glasses with the borders abounded with shiny diamonds. A 23 years old detective that was forced to drop out from his previous job because of a tiny misunderstanding. He was still regretting his actions while catching the sight of the letter: a black envelope spreading a feeling of eeriness throughout the room. There was a list of names written using blue ink: “Monica, Lucas, Phoenix, Scarlet, John, Charlie with big bold letters. It continues: “Please come to the cabin when you see this letter, be quick!”. Phoenix scratches his head. Monica, this name seems familiar…"

def Act_2():
    return "Running through the dark woods with the cold wind killing his vulnerable skin, heaving in sight was a small cabin. Phoenix opened the heavy door followed by a loud squeaky sound. Looking inside were five eyes blinking suspiciously at me, they were gazing at my whole body which made me feel bizarre. “Hi I’m John, a 3rd year student at University of Amsterdam. What’s your name? There was a few minutes of silence. I stared at John, who wore a striped jacket with a black rim beneath his eyes. “I am Phoenix, a 23 year old detective, once was…” My answer was interrupted by a deep tenor voice, “Are you all invited by the mysterious letter?” Scarlet, Monica and Lucas look at the speaker, all nodding in silence. Charlie, the person who introduces the concern…suddenly, felt the extinguish of fire."

def Act_3():
    return "Not only Charlie, everyone standing in the crowd recognizes this move. There was no warmth in the room, with each of the individuals encircled by despire and horror. Everybody turned to Charlie with a dead stare, they all have the feeling that this must be something to do with him. Lukas on the other hand started to scream with panic, falling down on his knees with blood dripping down from his eyes. What did I do? Did I murderer him? More and more questions blow out from Charile’s head. Slow and calm, Phoenix started to speak, “Calm down everyone, I think this is not what we think it is. It is the murder that is misleading us, be focused guys!” On the right side by the shelf, Monica and Scarlet are holding each other's hands with tears sliding down from their cheeks. Through their faces, Phoenix could see haunting fear. Charlie stretches out his quivering hands and places it below Lukas’s nose. No breathe."
