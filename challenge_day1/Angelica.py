def par1():
    return f"ACT 1/ In the heart of dense forest, far from civilization's comforting embrace, there stood a cabin. As the pale moon glowed upon the woods, six individuals found themselves drawn to this cabin, each driven by their own obscure motives. {Paula.my_character()}, {caleb.my_character()}, {Angeline.mycharacter()}, Scarlet, {file.char_name()}, and {RavenHaesakkers.my_character()}… Strangers to one another, they had converged upon this desolate place, unaware of the chilling destiny that awaited them within its walls. Scarlet heard that the biggest party of the city was being held in the woods. She had invited her friend but he said he couldn't make it until later that night. She got ready and got to the address early, excited for what she thought would be the night of her life."


def par7():
    return f"ACT 2/ When {RavenHaesakkers.my_character()} arrived, the guest list was completed. Scarlet, still hoping for the fun night she was promised, approached {Paula.my_character()}. They both sensed that something strange is going on. As Scarlet discovered that {Paula.my_character()} is not here for the party, her face went blank. {Angeline.mycharacter()} was still stuck on that name: {Paula.my_character()}…{Paula.my_character()}? Where do I know her from? When he arrived at the cabin she approached two young ladies, who were conversing and he immediately recognised one of the faces. Meanwhile, across the room, {file.char_name()} and {RavenHaesakkers.my_character()} had fallen into an eerie silence. Their eyes were fixed on {caleb.my_character()}, with an intensity that bordered on terror. It was as if they had seen a ghost, and whatever {caleb.my_character()} represented sent shivers down their spines, casting a shadow over what was meant to be a carefree evening."


def par13():
    return f"ACT 3/ The room descended into chaos as panic rippled through the crowd. Scarlet's tears flowed uncontrollably, her trembling voice echoing her despair. {file.char_name()}, usually the figure of composure, was now in a state of sheer panic. The atmosphere was thick with disbelief and terror; no one could fathom the night taking such a horrific turn. No one can believe {Paula.my_character()} is dead. Who could have done that? And will they do it again? Everyone is blaming {caleb.my_character()}. He was the one who found her, he was the one that last saw her. {Angeline.mycharacter()}, though, couldn't ignore his gut feeling that something wasn't right. He knew {caleb.my_character()} wasn't the killer, but the mounting pressure and fear in the room seemed to drown out any reasoning. Who else could have done it, after all? As tension reached its peak, plunging the room into a disorienting silence, the lights suddenly flickered and went out, shrouding everyone in darkness."
