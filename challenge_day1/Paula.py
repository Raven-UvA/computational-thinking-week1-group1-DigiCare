    return "Monica, the laid-back photographer, had brought her camera to capture the forest after dusk. She had heard tales of the cabin's eerie beauty, but the sight of the woods at night sent shivers down her spine. As she snaped photos she couldn't shake the feeling that they were not alone in the darkness. Her camera captured strange orbs of light and mysterious shapes lurking in the background. As Monica ventured deeper into the woods, she came upon a clearing where the moonlight revealed an old, decrepit cabin hidden among the trees. She reached the kabin and saw the guest list written on a piece of paper, nailed to the front door. “Monica, Lukas, Phoenix, Scarlet, John, Charlie”...??"

She clutched her camera tightly, her hands trembling uncontrollably. Panic took hold, and her breathing grew shallow and rapid. Phoenix and Lukas watched in growing alarm as Monica's eyes darted between the photographs on her camera's LCD screen. The images wer chilling – John standing in the dimly lit cabin, his expression one of fear and confusion. In the next frame, he was gone, leaving an empty room behind. Scarlet and Charlie were screaming their lungs out. Monica's panic attack intensified as she realized that the evidence was right there in front of her, suggesting that something malevolent had snatched John away, and she was the only witness to the horrifying vanishing act."

Her screams echoed through the night as she stumbled out of the cabin, her vision blurred by tears. A desperate, heart-wrenching need to escape the horrors within drove her into the sinister embrace of the woods. Scarlet ran through the gnarled trees, her breaths jagged, her footsteps pounding in rhythm with her racing heart. She was haunted by the faces of Monica and Lukas. She forgot about Charlie and John. In the dim moonlight, she glimpsed shadows that seemed to move with a malevolent purpose. Before she could comprehend the true nature of the terror that pursued her, it was too late. Scarlet's anguished cries were silenced in a nightmarish instant as she too met a gruesome end, swallowed by the enigmatic darkness of the woods. "
